## INTRODUCTION ##
My FITAPP is not a cumbersome app. It's just a simple and easy to use app with a friendly User Interface design that is easy to navigate to. It can be easily operated by anyone, even if the individaul is not a so friedly with using technology and is totally new to it. It has a very simple and catchable UI. 
Initially the once the app opens up it takes the user to the home page where the user finds the a motviational thought written just to make them ready to do the workout. And after that when the user presses the START WORKOUT button then a list of different workouts appear. 
The user then can select any of the workouts they would like to start with such as if a person wants to do CARDIO they can select that option and a timer will appear on the upcoming screen and the individuals can add whatever they want to enter and can start doing the workout instantly with the timer counting the time.

## OBJECTTIVE OF THE PROJECT ##
The main objective behind creating the app is to make the easy and convenient way to shape yourself within restricted time span, for the individuals who feel trouble or doesn't able to make it to the gym due their hectic schedules. 
It demonstrates the use of Android Smartphone and enlightens how it can be used to produce better functionalities for the ease of human lifestyle.
The smart way to work within this world is to connect everyting to a centralized database and store information in the cloud. And it has proved to be the most effective thing.
> The amount of paper used
> Reduction in the cost 
> Makes the app available to all the people as it an open source app
> Makes the app understandable to all the people at once without having any issues.

### Scope of the Project ### 
> The app is absolutely user friendly
> It provided users a good interface to interact with it.



## REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS ##
The contstruction of the app doesn't require much resouces. All you need is Android Studio installed in your personal computer, with a knowledge of implementing your ideas on creating the structure of the app you want to create. 
Also this app doesn't require any modules or external libraries or dependencies.

### Functionaal and Non-functional Requirements ###
A **functional requirement** defines a function of a system or its component. A function is described as a set of inputs, the behaviour, and outputs.

> The functional requirement of this app is not much as it just performs the basic fuctionnal not much structural compositions is required.
    - The app allows all the users operate it without having to register or to sign up.
    - The system shall allow the users to post whatever they would like to inpout.


A **non-fucntional requirement** is a requirement is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours.

> **Compatibilty**
  - The app is easy to operate and accessible
  - It should allow the users to access without any restrictions.

> **Reliability and availability**
  - The app shoud be obtainable from anywhere where there is internet availabilty.
  - System should be ableto give response on time. Loading time of the system should no be much.

### User Requirements ###
> User should be able to navigate the app without any difficulty
> User should be able to access the available information.
> User should be able to input whatever information they would like to enter in between their workouts.

### Software Requirements ###
> Microsoft Windows 10
> Google Chrome or Mozila Firefox
> Android Studio 2020
> Microsoft's SQL Server


## FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ##
**Feasibility study** 
-A feasility study is an analysis that takes all of a project's relevant factors into account - including _economic, technical, legal and scheduing considerations_ to ascertain the likelihood of completing the project successfully.
    
 **Operational Feasibility**
 -Operational feasibleness study tests the operatoinal scope of the system to be developed.\
 - In case of any inaccuracy like operating the app, the user is created privy to the error messages
 - The usability is moderate
 - Response time of the app is rapid.
 - The app is created with clear and straightforward to know navigation that permits the user to pursue the operation quickly

 **Economical Feasibility**
 -The purpose of the economic practicableness assessment is to work out the positive economic edges that the project system can offer. There are a bunch of edges from the project system like:
 - An existing system is manual, wherever information might not be availabel out on time. However, projected system are computerized, there was able to overcome all the hurdles of the existing system.
 - It can save a lot of time an efforts of the folks.

 **Technical Feasibility**\
 -There's not much technical implications that are being used in this project. It is an internet based mostly computer program therefore it provides a straightforward access to the users. Permission to the users would be granted easily. Hence, it provides the technical guarantee of smootheness, unreliability and security.
    



## FUCNTIONALITY OF THE APP ##
1 The app doensn't required the user to sign in or verify their usename or emails.\
2 User can track their exercises with the timer that has been installed in the app.\
3 As it has been stated in the introduction, that user can manually enter different forms of exercises to it.\
4 The person can't veiw other people's activities as it is not that advanced versions it is just a simple and quick app.\
5 Supports both the portrait and landscape.
 
## FEATURES WITH USE CASES ##

1. Using activities instead of fragments
2. Threading
- Timer / Clock
3. Gestures
- Lists, navigation, Layouts
4. Animations
- Transition between views
5. Internet Connectivity

## DRAWABLES ## 
Drawables includes the images that the app includes for the User Interface to look attractive and acceptable to the user.

## PROCESS MODEL ##
![File Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68032647/115439997-78fa4500-a1cc-11eb-9fc2-7a6dcdfbf6ef.png)


a) **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**
- Requirements for the project are collected and secured in this area 

b) **System Design**
- System structure and blueprint are created

c) **Implementation**
- The blueprint and derivation are development in this spot

d) **Integration and Testing**
- The components of the app are being tested

e) **Maintenance**
- The app doesn't require much maintainance

In this project the waterfall model is used is not quite used but it's just for elaborating the justifying the project view for the reader to find a better idea of how it works.
1. All the requirements are clear and maintained.
2. Requirements are not ambiguous.
3. The blueprint and contruction of the app was done.
4. Ample resources with required expertise were available freely.
5. The project is stubby.

## BUG LIST ##
- First wasn't sure on how to start the creating the app but thought of the idea of implementing it somehow
- Late searched for a couple of tutorials to get a glimpse or a rough idea on how to get a head start with that
- Encountered quite a bit of issues such as running on the emulator or importing the dependencies
- But while using the search engine juxtaposingly was able to figure those bugs out
- And was able to run the app successfully


## FINAL OVERVIEW ##

This section shows the final images of how the app looks actually after running on the device.
- So after the app loads on the device theh first screen shows up as the image below
- Then the workout options are being displayed
- And later after the user selects the type of workout they want to do the time screen shows up
