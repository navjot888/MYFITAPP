It can be easily operated by anyone, even if the individaul is not a so friedly with using technology and is totally new to it. It has a very simple and catchable UI. 
Initially the once the app opens up it takes the user to the home page where the user finds the a motviational thought written just to make them ready to do the workout. And after that when the user presses the START WORKOUT button then a list of different workouts appear. 
The user then can select any of the workouts they would like to start with such as if a person wants to do CARDIO they can select that option and a timer will appear on the upcoming screen and the individuals can add whatever they want to enter and can start doing the workout instantly with the timer counting the time.
